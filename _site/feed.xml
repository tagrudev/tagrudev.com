        <title>The Road to 10 000 push ups</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2018 I started a physical challenge with a friend of mine, we decided to start doing 50 push ups a day as a way to get in shape, this quickly turned into something more serious and we invited a couple of friends to join. Being a web developer, it was not hard to build something that will keep track of our current progress and in 2019 the &lt;a href=&quot;https://outmuscle.me&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Outmuscle Me&lt;/a&gt; project was born. A lot more people liked the idea and joined our challenge, it evolved into 6 months of doing Push Ups, competing against each other, finding the motivation of doing exercises each day.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Outmuscle Me</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://tagrudev.com/2019/the-art-of-push-ups/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Art of Push Ups&lt;/a&gt;, in that blog post I presented a tool that I’ve developed in order to keep track of my training activities. Surprisingly it grew on its own, there are more than 30 active users, not that many, but enough to give me a push to develop it a little bit further.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Art of Push Ups</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A push-up (or press-up) is a common calisthenics exercise beginning from the prone position, or the front leaning rest position. They are also a common form of punishment used in the military, school sport, or in some martial arts disciplines.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My 2019 challenge</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Four years ago I decided to start with the the thing called “yearly challenge”, the reason was I had just passed my mid twenties and I felt like it was time to go back and do a retrospective. Time to look at the things I’ve done wrong, could have done better or missed doing. The result / conclusion was that I didn’t really go out of my comfort zone and I needed to change that (reading in my inner voice):&lt;/p&gt;
