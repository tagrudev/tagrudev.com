        <title>The Art of Push Ups</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A push-up (or press-up) is a common calisthenics exercise beginning from the prone position, or the front leaning rest position. They are also a common form of punishment used in the military, school sport, or in some martial arts disciplines.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My 2019 challenge</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Four years ago I decided to start with the the thing called “yearly challenge”, the reason was I had just passed my mid twenties and I felt like it was time to go back and do a retrospective. Time to look at the things I’ve done wrong, could have done better or missed doing. The result / conclusion was that I didn’t really go out of my comfort zone and I needed to change that (reading in my inner voice):&lt;/p&gt;
